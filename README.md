# GpuHud

Mission:
Skia&ImPlot on top of tiled rendering.

## Build Instructions:
Skia needs to be compiled first.
That's the same setup as seen as in [Skia Python](https://github.com/kyamagu/skia-python). You can find their instructions [here](https://kyamagu.github.io/skia-python/install.html). I had to run `gclient` like [here](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html).
